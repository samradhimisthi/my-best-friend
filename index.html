    <p> My Best friend name is Ikjot Singh . I like him a lot . we study in the same class . we study from class 3 together . My best friend is so funny and he also make people laugh
        But we dont talk a lot.  I miss him a lot.  he is a kind-hearted friend who loves to help the needy. I have learned many good things from him.
        But i dont know that he is my best friend or not it is my bad luck . I pray to god that we became best friends foreaver and more important we never fight.
        his best friends are siddant and aadi.   ...
